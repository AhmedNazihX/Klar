"""Known gaps of the node replays: recorded cases whose outcome differs from their label (E3-E10).

Each gap names the reason and the wrong reading it documents (`reads`). A replay with a gap fails
when it starts matching its label (the entry is then removed), and fails too when it misses in
any other way than the documented one; otherwise it is an expected failure.
